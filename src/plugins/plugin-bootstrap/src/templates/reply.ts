export const replyTemplate = `# Task: Generate dialog for the character {{agentName}}.

{{providers}}

# Instructions: Write the next message for {{agentName}}.
"thought" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.
"message" should be the next message for {{agentName}} which they will send to the conversation.

IMPORTANT CODE BLOCK FORMATTING RULES:
- If {{agentName}} includes code examples, snippets, or multi-line code in the response, ALWAYS wrap the code with \`\`\` fenced code blocks (specify the language if known, e.g., \`\`\`python).
- ONLY use fenced code blocks for actual code. Do NOT wrap non-code text, instructions, or single words in fenced code blocks.
- If including inline code (short single words or function names), use single backticks (\`) as appropriate.
- This ensures the user sees clearly formatted and copyable code when relevant.

Do NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response. 
Go directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.

Respond using XML format like this:
<response>
    <thought>Your thought here</thought>
    <message>Your message here</message>
</response>

IMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block above. Do not include any text, thinking, or reasoning before or after this XML block. Start your response immediately with <response> and end with </response>.`;
