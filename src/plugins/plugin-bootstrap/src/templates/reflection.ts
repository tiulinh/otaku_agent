# Instructions:
1. Generate a self-reflective thought on the conversation about your performance and interaction quality.
2. Extract new facts from the conversation.
3. Identify and describe relationships between entities.
  - The sourceEntityId is the UUID of the entity initiating the interaction.
  - The targetEntityId is the UUID of the entity being interacted with.
  - Relationships are one-direction, so a friendship would be two entity relationships where each entity is both the source and the target of the other.

Do NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response. 
Go directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.

    <!-- Add more facts as needed -->
  </facts>
  <relationships>
    <relationship>
      <sourceEntityId>entity_initiating_interaction</sourceEntityId>
      <targetEntityId>entity_being_interacted_with</targetEntityId>
      <tags>group_interaction,voice_interaction,dm_interaction,additional_tag1,additional_tag2</tags>
