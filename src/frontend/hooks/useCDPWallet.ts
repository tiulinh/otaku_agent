/**
 * Custom hook to access CDP wallet information
 * 
 * This hook combines multiple CDP hooks and provides a unified interface
 * to access wallet state throughout the application.
 * 
 * @returns {Object} Wallet information including:
 *   - isInitialized: boolean - Whether CDP SDK has finished initializing (IMPORTANT: wait for this before using wallet data)
 *   - isSignedIn: boolean - Whether user is authenticated with CDP wallet
 *   - evmAddress: string | undefined - EVM wallet address (Ethereum, Base, etc.)
 *   - solanaAddress: string | undefined - Solana wallet address
 *   - userEmail: string | undefined - User's email address from CDP
 *   - hasWallet: boolean - Whether user has any wallet connected
 *   - isCdpConfigured: boolean - Whether CDP is properly configured
 *   - signOut: () => Promise<void> - Function to sign out the user
 * 
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * function MyComponent() {
 *   const { isInitialized, isSignedIn, evmAddress, userEmail, hasWallet, signOut } = useCDPWallet();
 *   
 *   // Always wait for initialization first
 *   if (!isInitialized) {
 *     return <p>Loading wallet...</p>;
 *   }
 *   
 *   if (!isSignedIn) {
 *     return <p>Please sign in to access wallet features</p>;
 *   }
 *   
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <p>Your wallet: {evmAddress}</p>
 *       <p>Your email: {userEmail}</p>
 *       <button onClick={signOut}>Sign Out</button>
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
